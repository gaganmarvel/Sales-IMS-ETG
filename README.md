# ETG Sales Inventory Management System
This respository is having all the python codes with json file for making an Inventory Management System for sales during my ETG AI/ML Internship.

It is a python based project intended to implement the Sales Inventory Management System using JSON files which provides the user to add, remove, search, update and view the products. It also allows customers to purchase the product. It then generates the bill after the purchase.
 Software used: Jupyter Notebook

### This Inventory Management System is working on No SQL based database :
1. Used 2 JSON files to store data.
2. product.json is used for data on products.
3. sales.json is used for data on purchase details.
4. New inventory can be created/added.
5. Purchase of products can be done.

There are 5 attributes per product:
1. Product ID
2. Product Name
3. Product Type
4. Product Price
5. Product Quantity

There are 5 attributes per purchase:
1. Bill Number
2. Product ID
3. Product Name

2. Display all products from the inventory.
3. Remove products from the inventory.
4. Search products from the inventory.
